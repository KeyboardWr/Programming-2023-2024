In python, data can be grouped in categories called Types.

| Name.  | Example            |
| ---        | ---            |
|string or str| "hello World"|
|Lists | [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]|
|Boolean or bool | True or False|
| Integer or int | 1 2 3 -10 1000 0 |
| Float | 1.2 -432.21 1.0 | 


An example showing the use of these names:

```python
favourite_food = "bibimap"
my age = 16
my_age_float = 16.0
# my_age_float is of type float

```


## Converting Types

These are some special functions built in to Python that helps to convert data from one type to another

```python
intro_string = "My age is"
my_age = 16

# Recall
"My name is" = "Jim" # My name isJim
"My name is" = " " "Jim # My name is Jim
```
