## Popularity and "Likes"

This type of paradigm makes a suggestion based on how many people "like" the thing.

One prime example of this, is the like button (Heart) in instagram. When you click on that heart button, instagram records it somewhere along with other data like demographic and psychographic information.  With this information, they might suggest to other users similar to you, products and service that you like.

We implemented the popularity/likes paradigm with our Favourite Bubble Tea activity 

## N-Point Rating System

N-point rating systems are used by many services particularly Jeff Bezos's baby, Amazon

This paradigm provides more granular information. Buyers are asked to rate the product on a 5-point scale. All the ratings are put together and an aggregate score is given out of five stars.


## Similarity Score

Amazon, Meta, TikTok, Netflix all use similarity scores to help-drive and keep users on their platforms

| Examples
| Amazon
| 
| Ubial_likes ("Nintento Switch", "Usb pd chargers", 4k Blu ray movies")}
| Ben_likes ("Nintendo Switch", "Usb pd charger", "lego")
| Fido Likes ("Lego", "Chew Toys" "Fuzzy Slipper")

Similarity scores indicate how similar two people are to each other.
Ben and Ubial have a similarity score of 2 "They like to things that are the same?"
Ubial and Fido have a similarity score of 0.
Ben and Fido have a similarity score of 1
