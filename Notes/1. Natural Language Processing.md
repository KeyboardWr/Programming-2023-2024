# Output 
We can display text and symbols using output

We use the print() function to display output

```python
print()
```

# Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are NOT interpreted by Python
This means that the text os "ignored" 
We use the # Symbol to give comments

# Header 
The first threee lines of code in our files are:

```
Python Gen
# Author
# Quote
#D ate
```

# Input

We grab information from the user using "Input ()
It will wait for the user to type something in and press Enter/Return
```python
input()
```

# Variable 
Variables allow us to store information for the time our app is running

```python
fourite food = input("What is your favourite food?")
```

favourite food -> name of the variable
= -> assignment operator
input ..... -> response
