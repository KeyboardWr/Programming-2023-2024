In python, lists are a collection of items
We store values inside of lists
The value of the items can be of different [[Types]]
**Order matters in a list**

# Creating a List
To make a list, we use brackets /()
We separate the individual items with commas

```python
some_list = ("Jimmy", "Sarah", "Frederick")
```

# Access Elements in the list

We can access the individual things fro lists using bracket notation
In the example below, we'll use bracket notation to access "Sarah"

```Python
some_list[1] # sarah
some_list[2] # Frederick
some_list[3] # Jimmy
some_list[-1] # Sarah
```

Inside the brackets, we give the index of the item we want
Python uses 0 index counting, which means we start counting at 0
