Modules are pieces of code that we can borrow in Python
This includes things like functions

>For example in random we used the .choice() function
to choose something randomly from [[lists]]

These pieces of coded are not automatically included,
so we need to import them into our code explicitly

# Import
The import keyword loads the module into our Python file
import should be at the top of our file, under the header

# The time Module
Time allows us to play around i=with anything related to time
Specifically we can use time to pause our code
